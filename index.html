        <p><strong>Now I want to generate an annual review report for Sarah.</strong></p>
        <p>As Senior Manager of Retail Operations, Sarah consistently exceeded expectations in 2024. She spearheaded major initiatives that boosted sales by 18%, optimized inventory levels reducing excess by 25%, and launched a highly successful customer loyalty program. While making great strides, there were some delays in new store openings. Sarah is a strong leader focused on driving results, though she can work on enhancing cross-functional collaboration in 2025. For her future career growth, Sarah is interested in taking on more strategic responsibilities and potentially transitioning into a regional leadership role overseeing multiple markets in the next 2-3 years.</p>
